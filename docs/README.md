## Introduction

Outpatient Departments (OPD) and Wards face significant bottlenecks because doctors spend the initial 5-10 minutes of every consultation gathering basic patient history. This reduces the time available for actual diagnosis and treatment.

"Medi-Triage" is an AI-powered, staff-assisted pre-consultation tool. It empowers hospital staff (e.g., nurses) to interview patients efficiently using an AI guide. The system supports hybrid input (Text & Voice), allowing the nurse to verify the input before converting the conversation into a draft structured medical summary (SOAP Note).
